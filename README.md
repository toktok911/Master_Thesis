# ABSTRACT

This study tries to explore the role that artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning classification algorithms, can contribute with, towards the detection of malicious Android mobile applications. 

It starts with illustrating the basic Android aspects that need to be understood and realized as prerequisites (the minimum required domain-knowledge) before solving the detection problem with Machine Learning. It follows by exploring how different Machine Learning classification algorithms were being applied by researchers and security practitioners in order to tackle the detection problem, in addition to comparing between those different approaches being followed according to many angles.

Theses angles are such as: the type of the datasets, how models were  selected, and which aspects were specifically targeted by the detection.

The research also applies four different algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks, on a dataset that characterizes behavior in terms of used permission. 
It also tests whether applying dimensionality reduction algorithms that produce a smaller version of the dataset actually helps in improving the accuracy of the built models or not. 

At the end, the research is concluded with a discussion of the findings, the possible limitations of this proposed approach, and recommendations for more enhanced future work in the emerging area of mobile security data science.
